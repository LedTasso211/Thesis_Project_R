This repository contains the data and R code necessary to reproduce the analysis presented in the bachelor thesis, "Who Gains from Economic Growth in Georgia? An Analysis of Income Distribution and Welfare Outcomes, 2004-2024".

Abtract: 
This thesis moves beyond Georgiaâ€™s stable economic growth for the past two decades and investigates how growth has been distributed among different percentiles of the population. To achieve this, the study employs a set of quantitative frameworks, along with a periodisation strategy that decomposes 
the two-decade span into four distinct political and economic periods:post-revolution liberalisation (2004-2007), crisis and aid-fueled recovery (2008-2012), political and economic transition (2013-2019), and the pandemic and war-driven boom (2020-2024).
For each sub-period, the analysis implements Growth Incidence Curves (GIC) to visualise growth across income percentiles, Cumulative Income-weighted Mean Growth (CIMG) curves for formal welfare assessments, 
income decomposition to identify the sources of income change, and Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions to model the changing returns to household characteristics.
The findings show that there is no single narrative of economic growth in Georgia. Instead, each period is characterised by a unique "distributional signature." 
The 2004-2007 period was defined by U-shaped, non-inclusive growth. The 2008-2012 crisis response, while successful in reducing absolute poverty, produced more pro-rich growth. 
The 2013-2019 period saw a shift towards social policy, resulting in pro-poor outcomes at the bottom of the distribution driven almost entirely by increased social transfers. Finally, the 2020-2024 period produced the only unambiguously welfare-improving growth (in relative terms) of these two decades.
Along with these findings, two consistent themes appear. First, social transfers have served as the single most important source of income for the poorest households across all four periods, indicating a structural failure of the market to integrate this segment of the population. 
Second, the RIF regressions reveal a persistent and dramatically increasing income premium for tertiary education, establishing the skills gap as a primary structural driver of market-based inequality.
